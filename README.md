# Corgi Sample Config

This is the template sample configuration for Corgi. Copy the contents of this directory to `~/.emacs.d` to get started.

Corgi is distributed as a set of packages for the Straight.el package manager. This is just an example of how to set up the Corgi package repository, load the main Corgi packages, and set up some other common things. It's a starting point. This is your config now, enjoy!
